        today's seek rise of lgbtq community how did this happen and why did this happen , i have the answers <br>
        
        government is pushing all of them so the majority of people can be a part of this community and be incapable to reproduce. <br>
        
        clever way to manage population <br>

        whenever the fck they want the big brother knows everything, knows when to play the right move when needed
        just building a perfect army and using them at the right time <br>
        
        well , the motto is to save the humanity , but at what cost <br>
        
        most people are so addicted that they are physically and mentally incapable to do anything reproductive <br>
        
        damm , no nothing they are just empty inside , useless <br>
